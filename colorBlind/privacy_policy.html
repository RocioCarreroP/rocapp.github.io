        <h2>What information does the app collect?</h2>
        <p>We do not store any data, the last and maximum level are saved on your own phone. <br/>
          This app does not collect personal information. <br/>
          The app does not secretly collect information such as your name, surname, telephone, email, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Why does the app use internet?</h2>
        <p>To show ads and have the option to continue on the level you were playing, in case you fail.
          Showing ads also helps us spend time improving the game.
          You can also use the app without internet, but you will lose the functionalities that the ads give you.</p>
          <h2>Contact us</h2>
